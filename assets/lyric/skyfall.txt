[00:32.09] This is the end
[00:36.88] Hold your breath and count to ten
[00:43.34] Feel the Earth move and then
[00:49.61] Hear my heart burst again
[00:57.46] For this is the end
[01:02.07] I've drowned and dreamt this moment
[01:08.56] So overdue, I owe them
[01:15.18] Swept away, I'm stolen
[01:22.72] Let the sky fall
[01:26.01] When it crumbles
[01:29.15] We will stand tall
[01:32.41] Face it all together
[01:35.64] Let the sky fall
[01:38.70] When it crumbles
[01:41.95] We will stand tall
[01:45.31] Face it all together
[01:47.64] At Skyfall
[01:53.86] At Skyfall
[02:00.52] Skyfall is where we start
[02:06.48] A thousand miles and poles apart
[02:12.58] Where worlds collide and days are dark
[02:16.89] You may have my number, you can take my name
[02:22.23] But you'll never have my heart
[02:26.77] Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
[02:30.03] When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
[02:33.18] We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
[02:36.49] Face it all together
[02:39.54] Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
[02:42.77] When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
[02:45.97] We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
[02:49.13] Face it all together
[02:51.63] At Skyfall
[02:54.38] (Let the sky fall)
[02:57.53] (When it crumbles)
[03:00.78] (We will stand tall)
[03:07.11] (Let the sky fall)
[03:10.25] (When it crumbles)
[03:13.53] (We will stand tall)
[03:17.73] Where you go, I go
[03:20.95] What you see, I see
[03:24.12] I know I'd never be me
[03:27.37] Without the security
[03:30.68] Of your loving arms
[03:33.77] Keeping me from harm
[03:36.97] Put your hand in my hand
[03:40.22] And we'll stand
[03:43.33] Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
[03:46.35] When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
[03:49.47] We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
[03:52.68] Face it all together
[03:55.78] Let the sky fall (let the sky fall)
[03:58.80] When it crumbles (when it crumbles)
[04:01.95] We will stand tall (we will stand tall)
[04:05.18] Face it all together
[04:07.43] At Skyfall
[04:10.23] Let the sky fall
[04:16.27] We will stand tall
[04:19.73] At Skyfall
[04:33.14] Ooh
